<h1 class="subtitle">A fun, hands-on <strong>weekend workshop</strong> for non-programmers to learn the basics</h1>

## Saturday April 27 and Sunday April 28<br /> <span class="subtitle">+ Meet &amp; Greet on the evening of Friday April 26</span>

**Have you ever wanted to learn the basics of programming?** Then join us for a weekend of playful coding! A friendly group of Berlin programmers are excited about sharing their joy of programming with you.

We have prepared a hands-on workshop for learning programming using JavaScript, the language that powers the web.

We speak GERMAN and/or ENGLISH.

**What you need:** Bring your laptop (or let us know you need one) and a curiosity about programming and how web sites work. The entire weekend is free. All welcome.
