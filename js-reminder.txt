Installing Chrome and Sublime Text 2:

To keep things simple, we'll all use the same web browser, Chrome, and the same text editor, Sublime Text 2. If you have *any* questions or problems, we are here to help! Bring your laptop to the Meet & Greet, and we will help you to with installation.

You can download Chrome here:

You can download Sublime Text 2 here:

Event Details:

Meet & Greet + Install Party
with pizza and beer
Friday July 20, 19:00

Not only can you sort out installation problems, but you can meet and mingle with other JavaScript-fanatics, the coaches and the organizers. The party and the workshop are the same location.


2-Day Workshop
Saturday July 21, 10:00 - 18:00
Sunday July 22, 10:00 - 18:00

We'll begin with an introduction and then we'll form small groups of 1-2 coaches for every 3-4 students. We will group you with people of the same experience level.

The core part of the workshop is planned until 18:00 each day. However, we want to keep things flexible. That means it may last longer. Or if you have to leave earlier, that's also okay.

Food and Drinks:

There are places to eat and a Kaisers nearby, but it'd would be awesome if we also had a little buffet, and everyone who can contribute brought some of their favorite snacks to share. Feel free to bring anything you like: fruits, veggies, salad, bread, cookies, nuts, etc.

At co.up you can buy beverages for â‚¬1 per bottle. But of course, you're free to bring your own drinks!

Other than that, just bring your laptop, your power cord and lots of enthusiasm.
You don't need anything more :)

We are looking forward to meeting you!
